## Project Overview

This dataset offers valuable insights into trends and metrics related to hospital respiratory data over a four-year period, covering:

###	Timeframe:
  o	Data spans from August 2020 through October 2024, capturing fluctuations in hospital metrics during both mandated and voluntary reporting periods.
  
### Scope:
  o Metrics are aggregated at national and state/territory levels, providing a comprehensive overview of respiratory illnesses across different regions.

### Data Points:
  **Hospital capacity and occupancy: Highlights how many beds were available and occupied during the period.
  **Hospitalizations and new admissions: Focuses on patient inflow due to respiratory illnesses.
  **Illness-specific metrics: Breakdowns for COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV, three major respiratory diseases during the timeline.

### Reporting Framework:
  **The dataset captures data during mandated periods (required by the CMS) and voluntary periods (when reporting was optional).
  **These shifts reflect changes in reporting requirements set by CMS and likely highlight how policies impacted data collection and completeness
